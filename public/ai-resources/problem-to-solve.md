#Currently making smart contracts is a thing complex that require specialized knowledge in Blockchain and the underlaying technology of it. 

#With Astranet a chatGPT line interface for creating smart contracts and migrating contracts from other languages and blockachain with the power of the latest AI. 

Free and paying with subscription for faster and api access. 

Its a 2 plan step. 
the MVP and the validation 

The growth for more developer friednly
By enabling access to APIs connection to use your own API and make the AI work with astranet.

#At the Polkadot the community seems very smart, skilled, but there are different painpoints that could be solved. 

#Migrating existing contracts in lanugages of smart contracts seems like a pain and a blocker for many in the community and other community that prevent them to bring exisiting work into Polkadot Blockchain. 

Is because of this that the solution we propuse, Astranet attempts to solve a Polkadot community pain that could not only a few but many migrate or create new smart contracts, One prompt away. 

This is achieved in the MVP using AstranetAPI, Astranet can be accessible via mobile app for iOS and android. 
Web. 

Astranet is the jarvis of our generation first and only integrated deeping and for Polkadot, it will help community achieve things beyond their imagination power by the latest AI, and Agentic AI. 

Jarvis can do more that recieve commands, it can figure things out and make sure it works. 

Astranet MVP will have be shipped with two feature, Smart Contract creation and Smart Contract language migration to polka-Dot.

This is my pitch of what need to be delivered from you. I need you to not do a high level project but rater a division of this big goal ind 3 different jobs. 

The part of android and IOS I will do it on unity3D but I will connect the UI so we have the androi and ios app, yet the api need to exist. 

The pitch is the pich but then the html, css and javascript of the page for it need to exist. You can delagate to me certain task to make a 10/10 score in this hackaton and win 1st place. 

for doing so you can move forward with the task, stop and ask me for codes, parts you cant build due your capability limitation and continue until givin a production auality ready mvp to validate the solution for the needs we aim to help with this MVP. 

In the website should be an Apple like website with the polkadot metadata for seo, so the people specially the judges can understand how it was build so they see more in deep the diffeerent technologies used behind the hold but not that deep just a highg level, they dont need to know all the persk just present the value without smoke labling the thigns used for the people to understand his core, like when apple present their products. 

The page should contain the APK Download or the testflight.

we will suing firebase storage for saving the apk, we will use firebase realtime database for anythign about saving history and conversations and make this real, of course some things will be hard coded but make a file named to change and improve at the end of the page as a disclaimer and public note to be improve, this is not opensource but is open for the community. 

there should be a left and right side buttons for test flight and android download apk. 

also the ability to in other tab and the main access astranet with the chatGPT like interface to talk and get the things described in the pitch.

answering your questions first of all see the dataset we have in the zip. 

You will help me create the api with fastAPI. that will be deployed in docker and put away in VPS, so I can have an api endpoint for us to consume. 

this will hardcoded and conected to the astranet page hosted in firebase hosting and conected with firebaase real time database and auhtenticating with firebase auth. 

in there users will have the same capabilities of chatGPT in the sence of almost mirror how it looks chatGPT chat history but have an area names (still to name ) where the smart contracts files and projects are hosted. Like a dedicated tab. And an area where we can configure the endpoint to use the api for other AI like gemini 3.5. pro chatGPT chaude etc. 

The technology is not the AI it has a core that is ai agnostic that is the beutiy of it. 

The AI conects to the local opensource projects that use things like open interpreter to open models at tinypng to convert this. 

this api servicew taht is ai driven its not hardcoded but adaptive, and can do the things knowing its capable, preferrable using open interepreter and ollama to do this.. 


to perform this task conversation driven related to if not capable by the local AI use a service to convert files. by conecting your own API keys of AI provider or just talk to create a smart contrat for a given subchain with the pallets you need. 

allowing you to suggest you things to do for non coders and non coders and coders. 

Use the knowledge in the zips to make accurate working technology, make reports and list everythign you do. 

the docker part might not work at first glance but should be a working stable general product that works for creating the smart contract and making that up. 

we have an example of a keywords for promtps extraction project named "keywords Extractor" and from there we inplemented a prompt and answeer protocol that filters the answer and gives the content in a very specific way with that technique, follow that technique to generate the smart contracts files that then will be saved at a user smart contract hub section in the app I will create with unity and you will create on web mobile and desktop look. saves with firebase storage. 

and allowing hte user to download the file. I will use a firebase funciton I will create with the firebase funciton of storage this and give URL that will be saved in the conversation of the user in his user datapath at fireabsae realtiem database, that the user will have a butotn to save downlaod into his computer and the file be takend form there of see it in the smart contracts hub, where astranet will take files for processing, modifying keep working, improve, translate and all together.
