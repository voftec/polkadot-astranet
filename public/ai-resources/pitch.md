Original pitch
Dear Polkadot community, Im Diego Aguirre a developer and founder of Voftec, new to polkadot and the community. 

I'm passionate about communtiy building and yesteraday I had the chance to meet amazing new indivuduals very talented with ideas that might change the world at a local meet up.

I’m here to give, collaborate, and grow with others. 

We are offering a Minimum Viable Product that empowers people to build smart contracts for free and effortlessly.

With the unique differentiator of allowing user community to translate smart contracts from other chains and languages, powered by the most advanced AI available.

This is a human-centered tool that lowers the barrier to blockchain innovation.

and this isn’t just a polkadoy hackaton hack submission. This is a door-opener.

Today I want to share what we've created with the welcoming and curious community of polkadot in mind. 

What we are shiping and demoing it to you today, we aiming to improve it and learn from it.

It can help you get started with polkadot and build amazing things, one prompt away, one conversation away.

This is the first of many contributions. I'm here to support others too.

Astranet:

"Imagine writing smart contracts without needing to know the syntax. Just describe it—or paste from another chain—and the AI will handle the rest. That’s what I’ve started here. My goal is to empower more people to build on Polkadot without friction.”

Starting today, MVP avaible at iOS Android with the aditional capability of voice to text and text to voice. And on web for desktop and mobile. 

A Front end / backend and working solution ready to help.

Dear Polkadot community,
I’m Diego Aguirre — a developer, and founder of Voftec, and I’m new to Polkadot and this incredible ecosystem.
I’m passionate about community building — and just yesterday, I had the chance to meet amazing individuals at a local Polkadot meetup at UTN University in Buenos Aires.
People with talent, vision, and ideas that might truly change the world.
That inspired me.
And it reminded me that innovation doesn’t happen in isolation — it happens in community.
So today, I’m here with my first real contribution to Polkadot.
Not just a submission for Nerdconf.
But something I hope the entire community can benefit from.
We’re offering a Minimum Viable Product that empowers anyone — technical or not — to create smart contracts, effortlessly, for free.
What makes it different?
It’s powered by the most advanced AI available — and it doesn’t stop at just writing contracts.
It can translate smart contracts from other chains and languages, like Solidity or Rust, and repackage them into something ready for Polkadot.
This is a human-centered tool that lowers the barrier to blockchain innovation.
And this isn’t just another hackathon project.
This is a door-opener.
We built it with the welcoming and curious spirit of the Polkadot community in mind.
What we’re shipping and demoing today is just the beginning — and we want your feedback to help us grow it further.
It can help anyone get started with Polkadot and build amazing things —
One prompt away. One conversation away.
So... how does it work?
You open the app.
You describe the smart contract you want in plain language — or paste a contract from Ethereum, Solana, or another chain.
The AI translates it, rewrites it, and delivers a ready-to-use contract for the Polkadot ecosystem.
No syntax. No steep learning curve. No friction.
And it's not just text —
You can use your voice to build contracts.
You can listen to outputs with voice synthesis.

And starting today —
Astranet is live.


Available now on iOS, Android (with voice-to-text and text-to-voice), and the web — both desktop and mobile.
A complete front-end and back-end solution —
built to serve the Polkadot ecosystem.

Let me show you how it works: 

(grab the phone goes to the app click on the button and then talk to jarvis like interface of astranet)

JArvis(astranet) is smart, proactive and cross devices. 

It can answer your question, do the smart contracts for you and manage the files for you across your smart contract ecossystmes. 

dear community, I'm happy to share with you today,
Test it now at Astrane

So.. starting today, is live Astranet.

You can either go to polkadotAstranet.web.app or to the polkadotAstranet.com and download to access the public beta on Android and iOS. (instant access wwaiting list)
