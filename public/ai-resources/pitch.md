Original pitch
Dear Polkadot community, Im Diego Aguirre a developer and founder of Voftec, new to polkadot and the community. 

I'm passionate about communtiy building and yesteraday I had the chance to meet amazing new indivuduals very talented with ideas that might change the world at a local meet up.

I’m here to give, collaborate, and grow with others. 

We are offering a Minimum Viable Product that empowers people to build smart contracts for free and effortlessly.

With the unique differentiator of allowing user community to translate smart contracts from other chains and languages, powered by the most advanced AI available.

This is a human-centered tool that lowers the barrier to blockchain innovation.

and this isn’t just a polkadoy hackaton hack submission. This is a door-opener.

Today I want to share what we've created with the welcoming and curious community of polkadot in mind. 

What we are shiping and demoing it to you today, we aiming to improve it and learn from it.

It can help you get started with polkadot and build amazing things, one prompt away, one conversation away.

This is the first of many contributions. I'm here to support others too.

Astranet:

"Imagine writing smart contracts without needing to know the syntax. Just describe it—or paste from another chain—and the AI will handle the rest. That’s what I’ve started here. My goal is to empower more people to build on Polkadot without friction.”

Starting today, MVP avaible at iOS Android with the aditional capability of voice to text and text to voice. And on web for desktop and mobile. 

A Front end / backend and working solution ready to help.
